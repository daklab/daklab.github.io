 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular and cellular changes are intrinsic to aging and age-related diseases. Prior cross-sectional studies have investigated the combined effects of age and genetics on gene expression and alternative splicing; however, there has been no long-term, longitudinal characterization of these molecular changes, especially in older age. RESULTS: We perform RNA sequencing in whole blood from the same individuals at ages 70 and 80 to quantify how gene expression, alternative splicing, and their genetic regulation are altered during this 10-year period of advanced aging at a population and individual level. We observe that individuals are more similar to their own expression profiles later in life than profiles of other individuals their own age. We identify 1291 and 294 genes differentially expressed and alternatively spliced with age, as well as 529 genes with outlying individual trajectories. Further, we observe a strong correlation of genetic effects on expression and splicing between the two ages, with a small subset of tested genes showing a reduction in genetic associations with expression and splicing in older age. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that, although the transcriptome and its genetic regulation is mostly stable late in life, a small subset of genes is dynamic and is characterized by a reduction in genetic regulation, most likely due to increasing environmental variance with age.},

 abstract = {Complex traits and diseases can be influenced by both genetics and environment. However, given the large number of environmental stimuli and power challenges for gene-by-environment testing, it remains a critical challenge to identify and prioritize specific disease-relevant environmental exposures. We propose a framework for leveraging signals from transcriptional responses to environmental perturbations to identify disease-relevant perturbations that can modulate genetic risk for complex traits and inform the functions of genetic variants associated with complex traits. We perturbed human skeletal-muscle-, fat-, and liver-relevant cell lines with 21 perturbations affecting insulin resistance, glucose homeostasis, and metabolic regulation in humans and identified thousands of environmentally responsive genes. By combining these data with GWASs from 31 distinct polygenic traits, we show that the heritability of multiple traits is enriched in regions surrounding genes responsive to specific perturbations and, further, that environmentally responsive genes are enriched for associations with specific diseases and phenotypes from the GWAS Catalog. Overall, we demonstrate the advantages of large-scale characterization of transcriptional changes in diversely stimulated and pathologically relevant cells to identify disease-relevant perturbations.},

 abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by motor neuron loss and that leads to paralysis and death 2--5 years after disease onset 1 . Nearly all patients with ALS have aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in their brains and spinal cords 2 , and rare mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 can cause ALS 3 . There are no effective TDP-43-directed therapies for ALS or related TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA-interference approaches are emerging as attractive therapeutic strategies in neurological diseases 4 . Indeed, treatment of a rat model of inherited ALS (caused by a mutation in Sod1) with ASOs against Sod1 has been shown to substantially slow disease progression 5 . However, as SOD1 mutations account for only around 2--5{\%} of ALS cases, additional therapeutic strategies are needed. Silencing TDP-43 itself is probably not appropriate, given its critical cellular functions 1,6 . Here we present a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for ALS that involves targeting ataxin-2. A decrease in ataxin-2 suppresses TDP-43 toxicity in yeast and flies 7 , and intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in the ataxin-2 gene increase risk of ALS 7,8 . We used two independent approaches to test whether decreasing ataxin-2 levels could mitigate disease in a mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy 9 . First, we crossed ataxin-2 knockout mice with TDP-43 (also known as TARDBP) transgenic mice. The decrease in ataxin-2 reduced aggregation of TDP-43, markedly increased survival and improved motor function. Second, in a more therapeutically applicable approach, we administered ASOs targeting ataxin-2 to the central nervous system of TDP-43 transgenic mice. This single treatment markedly extended survival. Because TDP-43 aggregation is a component of nearly all cases of ALS 6 , targeting ataxin-2 could represent a broadly effective therapeutic strategy. To test the hypothesis that a decrease in ataxin-2 levels can res-cue neurodegenerative phenotypes caused by TDP-43 accumula-tion, we first used a genetic approach. There are several transgenic mouse lines that express wild-type or mutant TDP-43, using various strategies 10},

 abstract = {Inference of directed biological networks from observational genomics datasets is a crucial but notoriously difficult challenge. Modern population-scale biobanks, containing simultaneous measurements of traits, biomarkers, and genetic variation, offer an unprecedented opportunity to study biological networks. Mendelian randomization (MR) has received attention as a class of methods for inferring causal effects in observational data that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables, but MR methods rely on assumptions that limit their application to complex traits at the biobank-scale. Moreover, MR estimates the total effect of one trait on another, which may be mediated by other factors. Biobanks include measurements of many potential mediators, in principle enabling the conversion of MR estimates into direct effects representing a causal network. Here, we show that this can be accomplished by a flexible two stage procedure we call bidirectional mediated Mendelian randomization (bimmer). First, bimmer estimates the effect of every trait on every other. Next, bimmer finds a parsimonious network that explains these effects using direct and mediated causal paths. We introduce novel methods for both steps and show via extensive simulations that bimmer is able to learn causal network structures even in the presence of non-causal genetic correlation. We apply bimmer to 405 phenotypes from the UK biobank and demonstrate that learning the network structure is invaluable for interpreting the results of phenome-wide MR, while lending causal support to several recent observational studies.},

However, inferring causal effects from observational data is notoriously challenging. Mendelian randomization (MR) has recently received increased attention as a class of methods for estimating causal effects using genetic associations. However, standard methods result in pervasive false positives when two traits share a heritable, unobserved common cause. This is the problem of correlated pleiotropy. Here, we introduce a flexible framework for simulating traits with a common genetic confounder that generalizes recently proposed models, as well as a simple approach we call Welch-weighted Egger regression (WWER) for estimating causal effects. We show in comprehensive simulations that our method substantially reduces false positives due to correlated pleiotropy while being fast enough to apply to hundreds of phenotypes. We apply our method first to a subset of the UK Biobank consisting of blood traits and inflammatory disease, and then to a broader set of 411 heritable phenotypes. We detect many effects with strong literature support, as well as numerous behavioral effects that appear to stem from physician advice given to people at high risk for disease. We conclude that WWER is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis in ever-growing databases of genotypes and phenotypes.},

Here, we introduce multi-set correlation and factor analysis (MCFA), an unsupervised integration method tailored to the unique challenges of high-dimensional genomics data that enables fast inference of shared and private factors. We used MCFA to integrate methylation markers, protein expression, RNA expression, and metabolite levels in 614 diverse samples from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine/Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis multi-omics pilot. Samples cluster strongly by ancestry in the shared space, even in the absence of genetic information, while private spaces frequently capture dataset-specific technical variation. Finally, we integrated genetic data by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of our inferred factors, observing that several factors are enriched for GWAS hits and trans-expression quantitative trait loci. Two of these factors appear to be related to metabolic disease. Our study provides a foundation and framework for further integrative analysis of ever larger multi-modal genomic datasets.},

 abstract = {Previous studies have prioritized trait-relevant cell types by looking for an enrichment of GWAS signal within functional regions. However, these studies are limited in cell resolution by the lack of functional annotations from difficult-to-characterize or rare cell populations. Measurement of single-cell gene expression has become a popular method for characterizing novel cell types, and yet, hardly any work exists linking single-cell RNA-seq to phenotypes of interest. To address this deficiency, we present RolyPoly, a regression-based polygenic model that can prioritize trait-relevant cell types and genes from GWAS summary statistics and single-cell RNA-seq. We demonstrate RolyPoly's accuracy through simulation and validate previously known tissue-trait associations. We discover a significant association between microglia and late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and an association between oligodendrocytes and replicating fetal cortical cells with schizophrenia. Additionally, RolyPoly computes a trait-relevance score for each gene which reflects the importance of expression specific to a cell type. We found that differentially expressed genes in the prefrontal cortex of Alzheimer's patients were significantly enriched for highly ranked genes by RolyPoly gene scores. Overall, our method represents a powerful framework for understanding the effect of common variants on cell types contributing to complex traits.},

 abstract = {The immune system is controlled by a balanced interplay among specialized cell types transitioning between resting and stimulated states. Despite its importance, the regulatory landscape of this system has not yet been fully characterized. To address this gap, we collected ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data under resting and stimulated conditions for 25 immune cell types from peripheral blood of four healthy individuals, and seven cell types from three fetal thymus samples. We found that stimulation caused widespread chromatin remodeling, including a large class of response elements shared between stimulated B and T cells. Furthermore, several autoimmune traits showed significant heritability in stimulation-responsive elements from distinct cell types, highlighting the critical importance of these cell states in autoimmunity. Use of allele-specific read-mapping identified thousands of variants that alter chromatin accessibility in particular conditions. Notably, variants associated with changes in stimulation-specific chromatin accessibility were not enriched for associations with gene expression regulation in whole blood -- a tissue commonly used in eQTL studies. Thus, large-scale maps of variants associated with gene regulation lack a condition important for understanding autoimmunity. As a proof-of-principle we identified variant rs6927172, which links stimulated T cell-specific chromatin dysregulation in the TNFAIP3 locus to ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Overall, our results provide a broad resource of chromatin landscape dynamics and highlight the need for large-scale characterization of effects of genetic variation in stimulated cells.},

To overcome technical limitations, we integrated genotyping of transcriptomes (GoT) with long-read single-cell transcriptomics and proteogenomics for single-cell profiling of transcriptomes, surface proteins, somatic mutations, and RNA splicing (GoT-Splice). We applied GoT-Splice to hematopoietic progenitors from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with mutations in the core splicing factor SF3B1. SF3B1mut cells were enriched in the megakaryocytic-erythroid lineage, with expansion of SF3B1mut erythroid progenitor cells. We uncovered distinct cryptic 3′ splice site usage in different progenitor populations and stage-specific aberrant splicing during erythroid differentiation. Profiling SF3B1-mutated clonal hematopoiesis samples revealed that erythroid bias and cell-type-specific cryptic 3′ splice site usage in SF3B1mut cells precede overt MDS. Collectively, GoT-Splice defines the cell-type-specific impact of somatic mutations on RNA splicing, from early clonal outgrowths to overt neoplasia, directly in human samples.},

Bonferroni correction, though computationally trivial, is overly conservative and fails to account for linkage disequilibrium between variants. Permutation-based methods are more powerful, though computationally far more intensive. We present an alternative correction method called eigenMT, which runs over 500 times faster than permutations and has adjusted p values that closely approximate empirical ones. To achieve this speed while also maintaining the accuracy of permutation-based methods, we estimate the effective number of independent variants tested for association with a particular gene, termed Meff, by using the eigenvalue decomposition of the genotype correlation matrix. We employ a regularized estimator of the correlation matrix to ensure Meff is robust and yields adjusted p values that closely approximate p values from permutations. Finally, using a common genotype matrix, we show that eigenMT can be applied with even greater efficiency to studies across tissues or conditions. Our method provides a simpler, more efficient approach to multiple-testing correction than existing methods and fits within existing pipelines for eQTL discovery.},

We address the challenge of scaling nonparametric Bayesian inference to the increasingly large datasets found in real-world applications, focusing on the case of parallelising inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). Our approach divides a large data set between multiple processors. The processors use message passing to compute likelihoods in an asynchronous, distributed fashion and to propagate statistics about the global Bayesian posterior.

 abstract = {Tumors comprise a complex microenvironment of interacting malignant and stromal cell types. Much of our understanding of the tumor microenvironment comes from in vitro studies isolating the interactions between malignant cells and a single stromal cell type, often along a single pathway. To develop a deeper understanding of the interactions between cells within human lung tumors we performed RNA-seq profiling of flow-sorted malignant cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and bulk cells from freshly resected human primary non-small-cell lung tumors. We mapped the cell-specific differential expression of prognostically-associated secreted factors and cell surface genes, and computationally reconstructed cross-talk between these cell types to generate a novel resource we call the Lung Tumor Microenvironment Interactome (LTMI). Using this resource, we identified and validated a prognostically unfavorable influence of Gremlin-1 production by fibroblasts on proliferation of malignant lung adenocarcinoma cells. We also found a prognostically favorable association between infiltration of mast cells and less aggressive tumor cell behavior. These results illustrate the utility of the LTMI as a resource for generating hypotheses concerning tumor-microenvironment interactions that may have prognostic and therapeutic relevance.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that gene expression levels change with age. These changes are hypothesized to influence the aging rate of an individual. We analyzed gene expression changes with age in abdominal skin, subcutaneous adipose tissue and lymphoblastoid cell lines in 856 female twins in the age range of 39-85 years. Additionally, we investigated genotypic variants involved in genotype-by-age interactions to understand how the genomic regulation of gene expression alters with age. RESULTS: Using a linear mixed model, differential expression with age was identified in 1,672 genes in skin and 188 genes in adipose tissue. Only two genes expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines showed significant changes with age. Genes significantly regulated by age were compared with expression profiles in 10 brain regions from 100 postmortem brains aged 16 to 83 years. We identified only one age-related gene common to the three tissues. There were 12 genes that showed differential expression with age in both skin and brain tissue and three common to adipose and brain tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Skin showed the most age-related gene expression changes of all the tissues investigated, with many of the genes being previously implicated in fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial activity, cancer and splicing. A significant proportion of age-related changes in gene expression appear to be tissue-specific with only a few genes sharing an age effect in expression across tissues. More research is needed to improve our understanding of the genetic influences on aging and the relationship with age-related diseases.},

 abstract = {Sequence-based variation in gene expression is a key driver of disease risk. Common variants regulating expression in cis have been mapped in many expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, typically in single tissues from unrelated individuals. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gene expression across multiple tissues conducted in a large set of mono- and dizygotic twins that allows systematic dissection of genetic (cis and trans) and non-genetic effects on gene expression. Using identity-by-descent estimates, we show that at least 40{\%} of the total heritable cis effect on expression cannot be accounted for by common cis variants, a finding that reveals the contribution of low-frequency and rare regulatory variants with respect to both transcriptional regulation and complex trait susceptibility. We show that a substantial proportion of gene expression heritability is trans to the structural gene, and we identify several replicating trans variants that act predominantly in a tissue-restricted manner and may regulate the transcription of many genes.},

A generative process for the tree structure is defined in terms of particles (representing the objects) diffusing in some continuous space, analogously to the Dirichlet diffusion tree (Neal, 2003b), which defines a tree structure over partitions (i.e., non-overlapping subsets) of the objects. Unlike in the Dirichlet diffusion tree, multiple copies of a particle may exist and diffuse along multiple branches in the beta diffusion tree, and an object may therefore belong to multiple subsets of particles. We demonstrate how to build a hierarchically-clustered factor analysis model with the beta diffusion tree and how to perform inference over the random tree structures with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We conclude with several numerical experiments on missing data problems with data sets of gene expression microarrays, international development statistics, and intranational socioeconomic measurements.},

In this study, we investigated gene expression changes in ALS via RNA sequencing in 380 postmortem samples from cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord segments from 154 individuals with ALS and 49 control individuals. We observed an increase in microglia and astrocyte gene expression, accompanied by a decrease in oligodendrocyte gene expression. By creating a gene co-expression network in the ALS samples, we identified several activated microglia modules that negatively correlate with retrospective disease duration. We mapped molecular quantitative trait loci and found several potential ALS risk loci that may act through gene expression or splicing in the spinal cord and assign putative cell types for FNBP1, ACSL5, SH3RF1 and NFASC. Finally, we outline how common genetic variants associated with splicing of C9orf72 act as proxies for the well-known repeat expansion, and we use the same mechanism to suggest ATXN3 as a putative risk gene.},

Here, we describe a deep neural network that accurately predicts splice junctions from an arbitrary pre-mRNA transcript sequence, enabling precise prediction of noncoding genetic variants that cause cryptic splicing. Synonymous and intronic mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence validate at a high rate on RNA-seq and are strongly deleterious in the human population. De novo mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence are significantly enriched in patients with autism and intellectual disability compared to healthy controls and validate against RNA-seq in 21 out of 28 of these patients.

This knowledge is used to derive two methods for classifying genuine mutations: a hypothesis testing framework and a mixture model.

We take the alternative approach of explicitly constructing the mixing measure, which allows more straightforward and efficient inference at the cost of no longer having a closed form predictive distribution.

However, the genetic basis of sensitivity to anthracyclines such as doxorubicin remains unclear. To begin addressing this, we created a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals and performed RNA-seq after 24h exposure to varying levels of doxorubicin. The transcriptomic response to doxorubicin is substantial, with the majority of genes being differentially expressed across treatments of different concentrations and over 6000 genes showing evidence of differential splicing. Overall, our observations indicate that splicing fidelity decreases in the presence of doxorubicin. We detect 376 response-expression QTLs and 42 response-splicing QTLs, i.e. genetic variants that modulate the individual transcriptomic response to doxorubicin in terms of expression and splicing changes respectively. We show that inter-individual variation in transcriptional response is predictive of cell damage measured \emph{in vitro} using a cardiac troponin assay, which in turn is shown to be associated with \emph{in vivo} ACT risk. Finally, the molecular QTLs we detected are enriched in lower ACT GWAS $p$-values, further supporting the \emph{in vivo} relevance of our map of genetic regulation of cellular response to anthracyclines.},

However, for each allele, accurate interpretation of its effect will depend on both its penetrance and the trait's expressivity. In this regard, an important factor that can modify the effect of a pathogenic coding allele is its level of expression; a factor which itself characteristically changes across tissues. To better inform the degree to which pathogenic alleles can be modified by expression level across multiple tissues, we have conducted exome, RNA and deep, targeted allele-specific expression (ASE) sequencing in ten tissues obtained from a single individual. By combining such data, we report the impact of rare and common loss-of-function variants on allelic expression exposing stronger allelic bias for rare stop-gain variants and informing the extent to which rare deleterious coding alleles are consistently expressed across tissues. This study demonstrates the potential importance of transcriptome data to the interpretation of pathogenic protein-coding variants.},

We have conducted an analysis of the impact of both sex and the X chromosome on patterns of gene expression identified through transcriptome sequencing of whole blood from 922 individuals. We identified that genes on the X chromosome are more likely to have sex-specific expression compared to the autosomal genes. Furthermore, we identified a depletion of regulatory variants on the X chromosome, especially among genes under high selective constraint. In contrast, we discovered an enrichment of sex-specific regulatory variants on the X chromosome. To resolve the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects, we generated and connected sex-specific chromatin accessibility to sex-specific expression and regulatory variation. As sex-specific regulatory variants can inform sex differences in genetic disease prevalence, we have integrated our data with genome-wide association study data for multiple immune traits and to identify traits with significant sex biases.

 abstract = {From whole organisms to individual cells, responses to environmental conditions are influenced by genetic makeup, where the effect of genetic variation on a trait depends on the environmental context. RNA-sequencing quantifies gene expression as a molecular trait, and is capable of capturing both genetic and environmental effects. In this study, we explore opportunities of using allele-specific expression (ASE) to discover cis-acting genotype-environment interactions (GxE)---genetic effects on gene expression that depend on an environmental condition. Treating 17 common, clinical traits as approximations of the cellular environment of 267 skeletal muscle biopsies, we identify 10 candidate environmental response expression quantitative trait loci (reQTLs) across 6 traits (12 unique gene-environment trait pairs; 10\% FDR per trait) including sex, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although using ASE is in principle a promising approach to detect GxE effects, replication of such signals can be challenging as validation requires harmonization of environmental traits across cohorts and a sufficient sampling of heterozygotes for a transcribed SNP. Comprehensive discovery and replication will require large human transcriptome datasets, or the integration of multiple transcribed SNPs, coupled with standardized clinical phenotyping.},

@article{Li2014rare,
 abstract = {Recent and rapid human population growth has led to an excess of rare genetic variants that are expected to contribute to an individual's genetic burden of disease risk. To date, much of the focus has been on rare protein-coding variants, for which potential impact can be estimated from the genetic code, but determining the impact of rare noncoding variants has been more challenging. To improve our understanding of such variants, we combined high-quality genome sequencing and RNA sequencing data from a 17-individual, three-generation family to contrast expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) within this family to eQTLs and sQTLs within a population sample. Using this design, we found that eQTLs and sQTLs with large effects in the family were enriched with rare regulatory and splicing variants (minor allele frequency 0.01). They were also more likely to influence essential genes and genes involved in complex disease. In addition, we tested the capacity of diverse noncoding annotation to predict the impact of rare noncoding variants. We found that distance to the transcription start site, evolutionary constraint, and epigenetic annotation were considerably more informative for predicting the impact of rare variants than for predicting the impact of common variants. These results highlight that rare noncoding variants are important contributors to individual gene-expression profiles and further demonstrate a significant capability for genomic annotation to predict the impact of rare noncoding variants..},

We quantified the contribution of cis-acting genetic effects at all major stages of gene regulation from chromatin to proteins, in Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). About 65\% of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have primary effects on chromatin, whereas the remaining eQTLs are enriched in transcribed regions. Using a novel method, we also detected 2893 splicing QTLs, most of which have little or no effect on gene-level expression.

Here, we describe Deep Mendelian Randomization (DeepMR), a method for estimating causal relationships between genomic marks learned by genomic DL models. By combining Mendelian randomization with in silico mutagenesis, DeepMR obtains local (locus specific) and global estimates of (an assumed) linear causal relationship between marks. In a simulation designed to test recovery of pairwise causal relations between transcription factors (TFs), DeepMR gives accurate and unbiased estimates of the true global causal effect, but its coverage decays in the presence of sequence-dependent confounding. We then apply DeepMR to examine the global relationships learned by a state-of-the-art DL model, BPNet, between TFs involved in reprogramming. DeepMR's causal effect estimates validate previously hypothesized relationships between TFs and suggest new relationships for future investigation.},

@article{Movassagh2011a,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epigenome refers to marks on the genome, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, that regulate the expression of underlying genes. A consistent profile of gene expression changes in end-stage cardiomyopathy led us to hypothesize that distinct global patterns of the epigenome may also exist.  METHODS AND RESULTS: We constructed genome-wide maps of DNA methylation and histone-3 lysine-36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) enrichment for cardiomyopathic and normal human hearts. More than 506 Mb sequences per library were generated by high-throughput sequencing, allowing us to assign methylation scores to ≈28 million CG dinucleotides in the human genome. DNA methylation was significantly different in promoter CpG islands, intragenic CpG islands, gene bodies, and H3K36me3-enriched regions of the genome. DNA methylation differences were present in promoters of upregulated genes but not downregulated genes. H3K36me3 enrichment itself was also significantly different in coding regions of the genome. Specifically, abundance of RNA transcripts encoded by the DUX4 locus correlated to differential DNA methylation and H3K36me3 enrichment. In vitro, Dux gene expression was responsive to a specific inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, and Dux siRNA knockdown led to reduced cell viability.  CONCLUSIONS: Distinct epigenomic patterns exist in important DNA elements of the cardiac genome in human end-stage cardiomyopathy. The epigenome may control the expression of local or distal genes with critical functions in myocardial stress response. If epigenomic patterns track with disease progression, assays for the epigenome may be useful for assessing prognosis in heart failure. Further studies are needed to determine whether and how the epigenome contributes to the development of cardiomyopathy.},

 abstract = {Nucleus classification is a central task in digital pathology. Given a tissue image, our goal is to classify detected nuclei into different types, for example nuclei of tumor cells, stroma cells, or immune cells. State-of-the-art methods achieve this by extracting different types of features such as morphology, image intensities, and texture features in the nucleus regions. Such features are input to training and classification, e.g. using a support vector machine. In this paper, we introduce additional contextual information obtained from neighboring nuclei or texture in the surrounding tissue regions to improve nucleus classification. Three different methods are presented. These methods use conditional random fields (CRF), texture features computed in image patches centered at each nucleus, and a novel method based on the bag-of-word (BoW) model. The methods are evaluated on images of tumor-burdened tissue from H&E-stained and Ki-67-stained breast samples. The experimental results show that contextual information systematically improves classification accuracy. The proposed BoW-based method performs better than the CRF-based method, and requires less computation than the texture-feature-based method.},

We define a partition-valued process on an arbitrary covariate space using Gaussian processes. We use the process to construct a multitask clustering model which partitions datapoints in a similar way across multiple data sources, and a time series model of network data which allows cluster assignments to vary over time.

In this note we take the former perspective and derive the ideal set of control variates for stochastic approximation variational Bayes under a certain set of assumptions. We then show that using these control variates is closely related to using the stochastic linear regression approximation technique we proposed earlier.

Statistical cluster analysis of intrinsic firing properties revealed that Hcrt/Orx neurons fall into two distinct types. These two cell types also differ in the complexity of their dendritic arbour, the strength of AMPA and GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic drive that they receive, and the density of low-threshold, 4-aminopyridine-sensitive, transient K+ current.

Current solutions side-step this optimization problem with surrogate objectives or Bayesian treatments. Instead, we make two simple modifications to optimization. Notably, their combination produces a heteroscedastic model with mean estimates that are provably as accurate as those from its homoscedastic counterpart (i.e. fitting the mean under squared error loss). For a wide variety of network and task complexities, we find that mean estimates from existing heteroscedastic solutions can be significantly less accurate than those from an equivalently expressive mean-only model. Our approach provably retains the accuracy of an equally flexible mean-only model while also offering best-in-class variance calibration.

Across individuals, we show that selective export of miRNAs occurs not only at the level of specific transcripts, but that a cluster of 74 mature miRNAs on chromosome 14q32 is massively exported in exosomes while mostly absent from cells. We also observe more interindividual variability between exosomal samples than between cellular ones and identify four miRNA expression quantitative trait loci shared between cells and exosomes. Our findings indicate that genomically colocated miRNAs can be exported together and highlight the variability in exosomal miRNA levels between individuals as relevant for exosome use as diagnostics.},

@article{Tung2017,
 abstract = {Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to characterize variation in gene expression levels at high resolution. However, the sources of experimental noise in scRNA-seq are not yet well understood. We investigated the technical variation associated with sample processing using the single cell Fluidigm C1 platform. To do so, we processed three C1 replicates from three human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. We added unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to all samples, to account for amplification bias. We found that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by genotype, but we also observed substantial variation between the technical replicates. We observed that the conversion of reads to molecules using the UMIs was impacted by both biological and technical variation, indicating that UMI counts are not an unbiased estimator of gene expression levels. Based on our results, we suggest a framework for effective scRNA-seq studies.},

@article{Wainberg2019-lb,
 abstract = {Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) integrate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression datasets to identify gene-trait associations. In this Perspective, we explore properties of TWAS as a potential approach to prioritize causal genes at GWAS loci, by using simulations and case studies of literature-curated candidate causal genes for schizophrenia, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and Crohn's disease. We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some likely to be non-causal, owing to sharing of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization with expression data from non-trait-related tissues or cell types, owing to substantial cross-cell-type variation in expression levels and eQTL strengths. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes more accurately than simple baselines. We suggest best practices for causal-gene prioritization with TWAS and discuss future opportunities for improvement. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using eQTL datasets to determine causal genes at GWAS loci.},

@article{Wessels2023-ko,
 abstract = {Transcriptome engineering applications in living cells with RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors depend on accurate prediction of on-target activity and off-target avoidance. Here we design and test ~200,000 RfxCas13d guide RNAs targeting essential genes in human cells with systematically designed mismatches and insertions and deletions (indels). We find that mismatches and indels have a position- and context-dependent impact on Cas13d activity, and mismatches that result in G--U wobble pairings are better tolerated than other single-base mismatches. Using this large-scale dataset, we train a convolutional neural network that we term targeted inhibition of gene expression via gRNA design (TIGER) to predict efficacy from guide sequence and context. TIGER outperforms the existing models at predicting on-target and off-target activity on our dataset and published datasets. We show that TIGER scoring combined with specific mismatches yields the first general framework to modulate transcript expression, enabling the use of RNA-targeting CRISPRs to precisely control gene dosage. A machine learning model predicts on-target and off-target activity of Cas13d in human cells.},

 abstract = {We introduce a new regression frame- work, Gaussian process regression networks (GPRN), which combines the structural properties of Bayesian neural networks with the nonparametric flexibility of Gaussian pro- cesses. GPRN accommodates input (pre- dictor) dependent signal and noise corre- lations between multiple output (response) variables, input dependent length-scales and amplitudes, and heavy-tailed predictive dis- tributions. We derive both elliptical slice sampling and variational Bayes inference pro- cedures for GPRN. We apply GPRN as a multiple output regression and multivariate volatility model, demonstrating substantially improved performance over eight popular multiple output (multi-task) Gaussian pro- cess models and three multivariate volatility models on real datasets, including a 1000 di- mensional gene expression dataset.},
