 abstract = {Groups of complex diseases, such as coronary heart diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, and cancers, often display overlapping clinical symptoms and pharmacological treatments. The shared associations of genetic variants across diseases has the potential to explain their underlying biological processes, but this remains poorly understood. To address this, we model the matrix of summary statistics of trait-associated genetic variants as the sum of a low-rank component - representing shared biological processes - and a sparse component, representing unique processes and arbitrarily corrupted or contaminated components. We introduce Clorinn, an open-source Python software that uses convex optimization algorithms to recover these components by minimizing a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm. Among others, Clorinn provides two significant benefits: (a) Convex optimization guarantees reproducibility of the components, and (b) The low-rank ``uncorrupted'' matrix allows robust singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component analysis (PCA), which are otherwise highly sensitive to outliers and noise in the input matrix. In extensive simulations, we observe that Clorinn outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in capturing the shared latent factors across phenotypes. We apply Clorinn to estimate 200 latent factors from GWAS summary data of 2,110 phenotypes measured in European-ancestry Pan-UK BioBank individuals N = 420,531 and 14 psychiatric disorders.},

We analyzed blood whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 24,049 individuals in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project and found that autosomal mCAs were significantly associated with increased AD risk (odds ratio = 1.27; P = 1.3e-5). This association varied by ancestry, mCA subtype, APOE ε4 allele status, and chromosomal location. Using matched blood WGS and brain single-nucleus RNA-seq data, we identified microglia-annotated cells in the brain carrying the same mCAs found in blood.

 abstract = {Subcellular RNA organization can affect critical cellular functions. However, our understanding of RNA microenvironments, particularly biomolecular condensates, remains limited, largely due to a lack of technologies to comprehensively interrogate mesoscale RNA organization. Here, we adapt Split-Pool Recognition of Interactions by Tag Extension to map micron-scale RNA-RNA spatial proximity genome-wide across cell regions (RNA-SPRITE). Deploying RNA-SPRITE, we find extensive, conserved organization of mature mRNAs, with increased colocalization between mRNAs that share RNA-binding protein (RBP) motifs or encode functionally related proteins. Both effects are especially strong in dendrites and axons, suggesting prevalent mRNA co-regulation. Moreover, mRNAs with less compact folding, lower translation efficiency, and specific RBP motifs are more likely to be in RNA-rich condensates. However, perturbations that broadly dissolve or enhance condensation reveal that RBP motif and encoded protein-mediated colocalizations largely remain intact, independent of condensation. These results demonstrate the power of RNA-SPRITE in revealing critical aspects of RNA’s functional organization. In Brief: Unbiased, genome-wide maps of RNA-RNA mesoscale spatial proximity uncover extensive subcellular organization and its governing principles. Highlights: RNA-SPRITE reveals micron-scale RNA colocalization genome-wide across cell regions; mRNA colocalization specificity is driven by shared motifs and encoded protein function; mRNAs with less compact folding, lower translation efficiency, and distinct protein-binding motifs are more likely to be in condensates; Neurites have a particularly high degree of sequence and function-dependent mRNA organization.},

This findings suggests that oncogenic mutations impair the lineage differentiation. After analyzing the resulting DNA methylation profiles, we identified many novel lineage differentiation genes in mutant cells showing DNA methylation alteration compared with wild-type cells, which is consistent with their methylation states in low-grade gliomas (LGGs) compared with control brain. Collectively, our results indicate that oncogenic mutations in stem cells are associated with DNA methylation changes for genes related to multipotency maintenance, differentiation resistance, and tumorigenesis, therefore, displaying impairment in lineage commitment.},

 abstract = {Long-read sequencing (LRS) has revealed a far greater diversity of RNA isoforms than earlier technologies, increasing the critical need to determine which, and how many, isoforms per gene are biologically meaningful. To define the space of relevant isoforms from LRS, many existing analysis pipelines rely on arbitrary expression cutoffs, but a single threshold cannot accommodate the broad variability in isoform complexity across genes, cell-types, and disease states captured by LRS. To address this, we propose using perplexity, an interpretable measure derived from entropy, that quantifies the effective number of isoforms per gene based on the full, unfiltered isoform ratio distribution. Calculating perplexity for 124 ENCODE4 PacBio LRS datasets spanning 55 human cell types, we show that it provides intuitive assessments of isoform diversity and captures uncertainty across genes with varying complexity. Perplexity can be calculated at multiple gene regulatory levels, from transcript to protein, to compare how isoform diversity is reduced across stages of gene expression. On average, genes have an ORF-level perplexity of 2.1, indicating production of two distinct protein isoforms. We extended this analysis to evaluate expression variation across tissues and identified 4,593 ORFs across 3,102 genes with moderate to extreme tissue-specificity. We propose perplexity as a consistent, quantitative metric for interpreting isoform diversity across genes, cell types, and disease states. All results are compiled into a community resource to enable cross-study comparisons of novel isoforms.},

 abstract = {Given the large number of genes significantly associated with risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, a critical unanswered question is the extent to which diverse mutations-sometimes affecting the same gene-will require tailored therapeutic strategies. Here we consider this in the context of rare neuropsychiatric disorder-associated copy number variants (2p16.3) resulting in heterozygous deletions in NRXN1, which encodes a presynaptic cell-adhesion protein that serves as a critical synaptic organizer in the brain. Complex patterns of NRXN1 alternative splicing are fundamental to establishing diverse neurocircuitry, vary between the cell types of the brain and are differentially affected by unique (non-recurrent) deletions1. We contrast the cell-type-specific effect of patient-specific mutations in NRXN1 using human-induced pluripotent stem cells, finding that perturbations in NRXN1 splicing result in divergent cell-type-specific synaptic outcomes. Through distinct loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms, NRXN1+/- deletions cause decreased synaptic activity in glutamatergic neurons, yet increased synaptic activity in GABAergic neurons. Reciprocal isogenic manipulations causally demonstrate that aberrant splicing drives these changes in synaptic activity. For NRXN1 deletions, and perhaps more broadly, precision medicine will require stratifying patients based on whether their gene mutations act through LOF or GOF mechanisms, to achieve individualized restoration of NRXN1 isoform repertoires by increasing wild-type and/or ablating mutant isoforms. Given the increasing number of mutations predicted to engender both LOF and GOF mechanisms in brain disorders, our findings add nuance to future considerations of precision medicine.},

However, gene expression cannot yet be systematically predicted from genome sequences, in part because non-functional matches to the sequence patterns (motifs) recognized by transcription factors (TFs) occur frequently throughout the genome. Large-scale functional genomics data for many TFs has enabled characterization of regulatory networks in experimentally accessible cells such as budding yeast. Beyond yeast, fungi are important industrial organisms and pathogens, but large-scale functional data is only sporadically available. Uncharacterized regulatory networks control key pathways and gene expression programs associated with fungal phenotypes. Here we explore a sequence-only approach to inferring regulatory networks by leveraging the 100s of genomes now available for many clades of fungi. We use gene orthology as the learning signal to infer interpretable, TF motif-based representations of non-coding regulatory regions, thus scaling comparative genomics beyond evolutionary comparisons where these regions can be aligned. We show that similarity of promoters in our motif-based representation predicts gene co-expression, and that we can infer known and novel regulatory connections in diverse fungi. Our new predictions include a pathway for recombination inC. albicans and pathways for mating and an RNAi immune response inNeurospora. Taken together, our results indicate that specific hypotheses about transcriptional regulation in fungi can be obtained for many genes from genome sequence analysis alone.},

Multiple RV association tests are available to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype, but most are restricted to per-gene models and do not fully leverage the availability of variant-level functional annotations. We propose Genome-wide Rare Variant EnRichment Evaluation (gruyere), a Bayesian probabilistic model that complements existing methods by learning global, trait-specific weights for functional annotations to improve variant prioritization. We apply gruyere to WGS data from the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Sequencing Project, consisting of 7,966 cases and 13,412 controls, to identify AD-associated genes and annotations. Growing evidence suggests that disruption of microglial regulation is a key contributor to AD risk, yet existing methods have not had sufficient power to examine rare non-coding effects that incorporate such cell-type specific information. To address this gap, we 1) use predicted enhancer and promoter regions in microglia and other potentially relevant cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons) to define per-gene non-coding RV test sets and 2) include cell-type specific variant effect predictions (VEPs) as functional annotations. gruyere identifies 15 significant genetic associations not detected by other RV methods and finds deep learning-based VEPs for splicing, transcription factor binding, and chromatin state are highly predictive of functional non-coding RVs. Our study establishes a novel and robust framework incorporating functional annotations, coding RVs, and cell-type associated non-coding RVs, to perform genome-wide association tests, uncovering AD-relevant genes and annotations.},

Here, a method was developed that integrates deep learning variant effect prediction (DL-VEP) scores from Enformer, DeepSea, and ChromBPNet models with cell-type specific regulatory annotations to improve fine-mapping of causal AD variants. Using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression, the largest proportion of heritability among brain cell types was found in microglia and the integration of Enformer microglia-based transcription factor DL-VEP scores and microglia ChromBPNet models further localizes the AD polygenic signal allowing for improved fine-mapping of causal AD variants. Functionally-informed fine-mapping using these annotations discovers 101 AD risk variants compared to 87 identified by statistical fine-mapping alone. Importantly, polygenic risk scores derived from these fine-mapped variants show improved cross-ancestry performance in both African American (AUC=0.532 vs. 0.521 for SUSIE) and Hispanic (AUC=0.552 vs. 0.535 for SUSIE) populations, while maintaining strong performance in European populations (AUC=0.620 vs. 0.615 for SUSIE). Through detailed analysis of the PICALM/EED locus, we demonstrate how our approach disentangles causal variants in regions of high linkage disequilibrium and predicts specific molecular mechanisms, such as disruption of PU.1 transcription factor binding, with the posterior inclusion probability of this variant increasing from 0.55 using SUSIE to 0.90 with our method.

 abstract = {Accurate quantification of RNA isoform abundance is crucial for understanding gene regulation, cellular behavior, and disease mechanisms. While short-read (SR) sequencing provides high-throughput and cost-effective transcript quantification, it suffers from read-to-transcript ambiguity. Long-read (LR) sequencing reduces this ambiguity but faces challenges such as high error rates, biases, and lower throughput. Existing methods rely on either SR or LR data and operate on single or merged samples, failing to leverage the variability across multiple samples and the complementary strengths of both technologies. As a result, they struggle to accurately quantify low-abundance and moderate-expressed isoforms and often require complex models for sample-specific bias correction. To address these limitations, we introduce JOLI, a hierarchical model that leverages multi-sample learning to enhance transcript quantification by jointly integrating SR and LR sequencing data. By incorporating multi-sample learning, JOLI captures shared transcript structures, corrects for systematic biases, and enhances statistical power, particularly for low- and moderate-abundance isoforms. Our model applies an empirical Bayes framework, learning a shared prior across samples to improve inference consistency. By jointly modeling SR and LR data, it integrates the strengths of both technologies, achieving higher accuracy and reproducibility in transcript quantification. Through benchmarking on simulated and real RNA-seq datasets, we show that JOLI consistently outperforms single-sample EM method by improving ranking consistency, proportional agreement, and estimation accuracy while enhancing reproducibility. Specifically, in simulations, JOLI multi-sample improves Spearman correlation by 9.8\% for LR and 7.7\% for SR data compared to single-sample method, while for real data, the improvements are 2.56\% (LR) and 1.28\% (SR), respectively. Multi-sample learning further improves the quantification of isoforms with low to moderate expression levels. Furthermore, JOLI performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness in transcript quantification.},

To achieve strong clustering performance, existing methods that replace the standard normal prior with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) require defining the number of clusters to be close to the number of expected ground truth classes a-priori and are susceptible to poor initializations. We leverage VampPrior concepts (Tomczak and Welling, 2018) to fit a Bayesian GMM prior, resulting in the VampPrior Mixture Model (VMM), a novel prior for DLVMs. In a VAE, the VMM attains highly competitive clustering performance on benchmark datasets. Integrating the VMM into scVI (Lopez et al., 2018), a popular scRNA-seq integration method, significantly improves its performance and automatically arranges cells into clusters with similar biological characteristics.},

 abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) contributes significantly to RNA and protein variability yet its role in defining cellular diversity is not fully understood. While Smart-seq2 offers enhanced coverage across transcripts compared to 10X single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), current computational methods often miss the full complexity of AS. Most approaches for single cell based differential splicing analysis focus on simple AS events such as exon skipping, and rely on predefined cell type labels or low-dimensional gene expression representations. This limits their ability to detect more complex AS events and makes them dependent on prior knowledge of cell classifications. Here, we present Leaflet, a splice junction centric approach inspired by Leafcutter, our tool for quantifying RNA splicing variation with bulk RNA-seq. Leaflet is a probabilistic mixture model designed to infer AS-driven cell states without the need for cell type labels. We detail Leaflet’s generative model, inference methodology, and its efficiency in detecting differentially spliced junctions. By applying Leaflet to the Tabula Muris brain cell dataset, we highlight cell-state specific splicing patterns, offering a deeper insight into cellular diversity beyond that captured by gene expression alone.},

 abstract = {Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism for diversifying proteins, in which mature RNA isoforms produce proteins with potentially distinct functions. Two major challenges in characterizing the cellular function of isoforms are the lack of experimental methods to specifically and efficiently modulate isoform expression and computational tools for complex experimental design. To address these gaps, we developed and methodically tested a strategy which pairs the RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas13d system with guide RNAs that span exon-exon junctions in the mature RNA. We performed a high-throughput essentiality screen, quantitative RT-PCR assays, and PacBio long read sequencing to affirm our ability to specifically target and robustly knockdown individual RNA isoforms. In parallel, we provide computational tools for experimental design and screen analysis. Considering all possible splice junctions annotated in GENCODE for multi-isoform genes and our gRNA efficacy predictions, we estimate that our junction-centric strategy can uniquely target up to 89\% of human RNA isoforms, including 50,066 protein-coding and 11,415 lncRNA isoforms. Importantly, this specificity spans all splicing and transcriptional events, including exon skipping and inclusion, alternative 5' and 3' splice sites, and alternative starts and ends.},

We find that mismatches and indels have a position- and context-dependent impact on Cas13d activity, and mismatches that result in G--U wobble pairings are better tolerated than other single-base mismatches. Using this large-scale dataset, we train a convolutional neural network that we term targeted inhibition of gene expression via gRNA design (TIGER) to predict efficacy from guide sequence and context. TIGER outperforms the existing models at predicting on-target and off-target activity on our dataset and published datasets.

Parametric methods that employ neural networks for these parameter maps can capture complex relationships in the data. Yet, optimizing network parameters via log likelihood gradients can yield suboptimal mean and uncalibrated variance estimates. Current solutions side-step this optimization problem with surrogate objectives or Bayesian treatments. Instead, we make two simple modifications to optimization. Notably, their combination produces a heteroscedastic model with mean estimates that are provably as accurate as those from its homoscedastic counterpart (i.e. fitting the mean under squared error loss). For a wide variety of network and task complexities, we find that mean estimates from existing heteroscedastic solutions can be significantly less accurate than those from an equivalently expressive mean-only model. Our approach provably retains the accuracy of an equally flexible mean-only model while also offering best-in-class variance calibration. Lastly, we show how to leverage our method to recover the underlying heteroscedastic noise variance.},

To overcome technical limitations, we integrated genotyping of transcriptomes (GoT) with long-read single-cell transcriptomics and proteogenomics for single-cell profiling of transcriptomes, surface proteins, somatic mutations, and RNA splicing (GoT-Splice). We applied GoT-Splice to hematopoietic progenitors from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with mutations in the core splicing factor SF3B1. SF3B1mut cells were enriched in the megakaryocytic-erythroid lineage, with expansion of SF3B1mut erythroid progenitor cells. We uncovered distinct cryptic 3′ splice site usage in different progenitor populations and stage-specific aberrant splicing during erythroid differentiation. Profiling SF3B1-mutated clonal hematopoiesis samples revealed that erythroid bias and cell-type-specific cryptic 3′ splice site usage in SF3B1mut cells precede overt MDS. Collectively, GoT-Splice defines the cell-type-specific impact of somatic mutations on RNA splicing, from early clonal outgrowths to overt neoplasia, directly in human samples.},

In a simulation designed to test recovery of pairwise causal relations between transcription factors (TFs), DeepMR gives accurate and unbiased estimates of the true global causal effect, but its coverage decays in the presence of sequence-dependent confounding.

We observed an increase in microglia and astrocyte gene expression, accompanied by a decrease in oligodendrocyte gene expression. By creating a gene co-expression network in the ALS samples, we identified several activated microglia modules that negatively correlate with retrospective disease duration. We mapped molecular quantitative trait loci and found several potential ALS risk loci that may act through gene expression or splicing in the spinal cord and assign putative cell types for FNBP1, ACSL5, SH3RF1 and NFASC. Finally, we outline how common genetic variants associated with splicing of C9orf72 act as proxies for the well-known repeat expansion, and we use the same mechanism to suggest ATXN3 as a putative risk gene.},

We propose a framework for leveraging signals from transcriptional responses to environmental perturbations to identify disease-relevant perturbations that can modulate genetic risk for complex traits and inform the functions of genetic variants associated with complex traits. We perturbed human skeletal-muscle-, fat-, and liver-relevant cell lines with 21 perturbations affecting insulin resistance, glucose homeostasis, and metabolic regulation in humans and identified thousands of environmentally responsive genes. By combining these data with GWASs from 31 distinct polygenic traits, we show that the heritability of multiple traits is enriched in regions surrounding genes responsive to specific perturbations and, further, that environmentally responsive genes are enriched for associations with specific diseases and phenotypes from the GWAS Catalog. Overall, we demonstrate the advantages of large-scale characterization of transcriptional changes in diversely stimulated and pathologically relevant cells to identify disease-relevant perturbations.},

However, inferring causal effects from observational data is notoriously challenging. Mendelian randomization (MR) has recently received increased attention as a class of methods for estimating causal effects using genetic associations. However, standard methods result in pervasive false positives when two traits share a heritable, unobserved common cause. This is the problem of correlated pleiotropy. Here, we introduce a flexible framework for simulating traits with a common genetic confounder that generalizes recently proposed models, as well as a simple approach we call Welch-weighted Egger regression (WWER) for estimating causal effects. We show in comprehensive simulations that our method substantially reduces false positives due to correlated pleiotropy while being fast enough to apply to hundreds of phenotypes. We apply our method first to a subset of the UK Biobank consisting of blood traits and inflammatory disease, and then to a broader set of 411 heritable phenotypes. We detect many effects with strong literature support, as well as numerous behavioral effects that appear to stem from physician advice given to people at high risk for disease. We conclude that WWER is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis in ever-growing databases of genotypes and phenotypes.},

Modern population-scale biobanks, containing simultaneous measurements of traits, biomarkers, and genetic variation, offer an unprecedented opportunity to study biological networks. Mendelian randomization (MR) has received attention as a class of methods for inferring causal effects in observational data that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables, but MR methods rely on assumptions that limit their application to complex traits at the biobank-scale. Moreover, MR estimates the total effect of one trait on another, which may be mediated by other factors. Biobanks include measurements of many potential mediators, in principle enabling the conversion of MR estimates into direct effects representing a causal network. Here, we show that this can be accomplished by a flexible two stage procedure we call bidirectional mediated Mendelian randomization (bimmer). First, bimmer estimates the effect of every trait on every other. Next, bimmer finds a parsimonious network that explains these effects using direct and mediated causal paths. We introduce novel methods for both steps and show via extensive simulations that bimmer is able to learn causal network structures even in the presence of non-causal genetic correlation. We apply bimmer to 405 phenotypes from the UK biobank and demonstrate that learning the network structure is invaluable for interpreting the results of phenome-wide MR, while lending causal support to several recent observational studies.},

In all cases, the resulting models achieve competitive performance commensurate with their simplicity, use of explicit probability models, and abstinence from adversarial training.},

 abstract = {Tumors comprise a complex microenvironment of interacting malignant and stromal cell types. Much of our understanding of the tumor microenvironment comes from in vitro studies isolating the interactions between malignant cells and a single stromal cell type, often along a single pathway. To develop a deeper understanding of the interactions between cells within human lung tumors we performed RNA-seq profiling of flow-sorted malignant cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and bulk cells from freshly resected human primary non-small-cell lung tumors. We mapped the cell-specific differential expression of prognostically-associated secreted factors and cell surface genes, and computationally reconstructed cross-talk between these cell types to generate a novel resource we call the Lung Tumor Microenvironment Interactome (LTMI). Using this resource, we identified and validated a prognostically unfavorable influence of Gremlin-1 production by fibroblasts on proliferation of malignant lung adenocarcinoma cells. We also found a prognostically favorable association between infiltration of mast cells and less aggressive tumor cell behavior. These results illustrate the utility of the LTMI as a resource for generating hypotheses concerning tumor-microenvironment interactions that may have prognostic and therapeutic relevance.  Summary RNA-seq profiling of sorted populations from primary lung cancer samples identifies prognostically relevant cross-talk between cell types in the tumor microenvironment.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular and cellular changes are intrinsic to aging and age-related diseases. Prior cross-sectional studies have investigated the combined effects of age and genetics on gene expression and alternative splicing; however, there has been no long-term, longitudinal characterization of these molecular changes, especially in older age. RESULTS: We perform RNA sequencing in whole blood from the same individuals at ages 70 and 80 to quantify how gene expression, alternative splicing, and their genetic regulation are altered during this 10-year period of advanced aging at a population and individual level. We observe that individuals are more similar to their own expression profiles later in life than profiles of other individuals their own age. We identify 1291 and 294 genes differentially expressed and alternatively spliced with age, as well as 529 genes with outlying individual trajectories. Further, we observe a strong correlation of genetic effects on expression and splicing between the two ages, with a small subset of tested genes showing a reduction in genetic associations with expression and splicing in older age. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that, although the transcriptome and its genetic regulation is mostly stable late in life, a small subset of genes is dynamic and is characterized by a reduction in genetic regulation, most likely due to increasing environmental variance with age.},

Here, we describe a deep neural network that accurately predicts splice junctions from an arbitrary pre-mRNA transcript sequence, enabling precise prediction of noncoding genetic variants that cause cryptic splicing. Synonymous and intronic mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence validate at a high rate on RNA-seq and are strongly deleterious in the human population. De novo mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence are significantly enriched in patients with autism and intellectual disability compared to healthy controls and validate against RNA-seq in 21 out of 28 of these patients.

We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some likely to be non-causal, owing to sharing of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization with expression data from non-trait-related tissues or cell types, owing to substantial cross-cell-type variation in expression levels and eQTL strengths. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes more accurately than simple baselines. We suggest best practices for causal-gene prioritization with TWAS and discuss future opportunities for improvement.

 abstract = {The immune system is controlled by a balanced interplay among specialized cell types transitioning between resting and stimulated states. Despite its importance, the regulatory landscape of this system has not yet been fully characterized. To address this gap, we collected ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data under resting and stimulated conditions for 25 immune cell types from peripheral blood of four healthy individuals, and seven cell types from three fetal thymus samples. We found that stimulation caused widespread chromatin remodeling, including a large class of response elements shared between stimulated B and T cells. Furthermore, several autoimmune traits showed significant heritability in stimulation-responsive elements from distinct cell types, highlighting the critical importance of these cell states in autoimmunity. Use of allele-specific read-mapping identified thousands of variants that alter chromatin accessibility in particular conditions. Notably, variants associated with changes in stimulation-specific chromatin accessibility were not enriched for associations with gene expression regulation in whole blood -- a tissue commonly used in eQTL studies. Thus, large-scale maps of variants associated with gene regulation lack a condition important for understanding autoimmunity. As a proof-of-principle we identified variant rs6927172, which links stimulated T cell-specific chromatin dysregulation in the TNFAIP3 locus to ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Overall, our results provide a broad resource of chromatin landscape dynamics and highlight the need for large-scale characterization of effects of genetic variation in stimulated cells.},

However, the genetic basis of sensitivity to anthracyclines such as doxorubicin remains unclear. To begin addressing this, we created a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals and performed RNA-seq after 24h exposure to varying levels of doxorubicin. The transcriptomic response to doxorubicin is substantial, with the majority of genes being differentially expressed across treatments of different concentrations and over 6000 genes showing evidence of differential splicing. Overall, our observations indicate that splicing fidelity decreases in the presence of doxorubicin. We detect 376 response-expression QTLs and 42 response-splicing QTLs, i.e. genetic variants that modulate the individual transcriptomic response to doxorubicin in terms of expression and splicing changes respectively. We show that inter-individual variation in transcriptional response is predictive of cell damage measured \emph{in vitro} using a cardiac troponin assay, which in turn is shown to be associated with \emph{in vivo} ACT risk. Finally, the molecular QTLs we detected are enriched in lower ACT GWAS $p$-values, further supporting the \emph{in vivo} relevance of our map of genetic regulation of cellular response to anthracyclines.},

 abstract = {From whole organisms to individual cells, responses to environmental conditions are influenced by genetic makeup, where the effect of genetic variation on a trait depends on the environmental context. RNA-sequencing quantifies gene expression as a molecular trait, and is capable of capturing both genetic and environmental effects. In this study, we explore opportunities of using allele-specific expression (ASE) to discover cis-acting genotype-environment interactions (GxE)---genetic effects on gene expression that depend on an environmental condition. Treating 17 common, clinical traits as approximations of the cellular environment of 267 skeletal muscle biopsies, we identify 10 candidate environmental response expression quantitative trait loci (reQTLs) across 6 traits (12 unique gene-environment trait pairs; 10\% FDR per trait) including sex, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although using ASE is in principle a promising approach to detect GxE effects, replication of such signals can be challenging as validation requires harmonization of environmental traits across cohorts and a sufficient sampling of heterozygotes for a transcribed SNP. Comprehensive discovery and replication will require large human transcriptome datasets, or the integration of multiple transcribed SNPs, coupled with standardized clinical phenotyping.},

To do so, we processed three C1 replicates from three human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. We added unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to all samples, to account for amplification bias. We found that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by genotype, but we also observed substantial variation between the technical replicates. We observed that the conversion of reads to molecules using the UMIs was impacted by both biological and technical variation, indicating that UMI counts are not an unbiased estimator of gene expression levels.

 abstract = {Previous studies have prioritized trait-relevant cell types by looking for an enrichment of GWAS signal within functional regions. However, these studies are limited in cell resolution by the lack of functional annotations from difficult-to-characterize or rare cell populations. Measurement of single-cell gene expression has become a popular method for characterizing novel cell types, and yet, hardly any work exists linking single-cell RNA-seq to phenotypes of interest. To address this deficiency, we present RolyPoly, a regression-based polygenic model that can prioritize trait-relevant cell types and genes from GWAS summary statistics and single-cell RNA-seq. We demonstrate RolyPoly's accuracy through simulation and validate previously known tissue-trait associations. We discover a significant association between microglia and late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and an association between oligodendrocytes and replicating fetal cortical cells with schizophrenia. Additionally, RolyPoly computes a trait-relevance score for each gene which reflects the importance of expression specific to a cell type. We found that differentially expressed genes in the prefrontal cortex of Alzheimer's patients were significantly enriched for highly ranked genes by RolyPoly gene scores. Overall, our method represents a powerful framework for understanding the effect of common variants on cell types contributing to complex traits.},

Across individuals, we show that selective export of miRNAs occurs not only at the level of specific transcripts, but that a cluster of 74 mature miRNAs on chromosome 14q32 is massively exported in exosomes while mostly absent from cells. We also observe more interindividual variability between exosomal samples than between cellular ones and identify four miRNA expression quantitative trait loci shared between cells and exosomes. Our findings indicate that genomically colocated miRNAs can be exported together and highlight the variability in exosomal miRNA levels between individuals as relevant for exosome use as diagnostics.},

 abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by motor neuron loss and that leads to paralysis and death 2--5 years after disease onset 1 . Nearly all patients with ALS have aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in their brains and spinal cords 2 , and rare mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 can cause ALS 3 . There are no effective TDP-43-directed therapies for ALS or related TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA-interference approaches are emerging as attractive therapeutic strategies in neurological diseases 4 . Indeed, treatment of a rat model of inherited ALS (caused by a mutation in Sod1) with ASOs against Sod1 has been shown to substantially slow disease progression 5 . However, as SOD1 mutations account for only around 2--5{\%} of ALS cases, additional therapeutic strategies are needed. Silencing TDP-43 itself is probably not appropriate, given its critical cellular functions 1,6 . Here we present a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for ALS that involves targeting ataxin-2. A decrease in ataxin-2 suppresses TDP-43 toxicity in yeast and flies 7 , and intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in the ataxin-2 gene increase risk of ALS 7,8 . We used two independent approaches to test whether decreasing ataxin-2 levels could mitigate disease in a mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy 9 . First, we crossed ataxin-2 knockout mice with TDP-43 (also known as TARDBP) transgenic mice. The decrease in ataxin-2 reduced aggregation of TDP-43, markedly increased survival and improved motor function. Second, in a more therapeutically applicable approach, we administered ASOs targeting ataxin-2 to the central nervous system of TDP-43 transgenic mice. This single treatment markedly extended survival. Because TDP-43 aggregation is a component of nearly all cases of ALS 6 , targeting ataxin-2 could represent a broadly effective therapeutic strategy. To test the hypothesis that a decrease in ataxin-2 levels can res-cue neurodegenerative phenotypes caused by TDP-43 accumula-tion, we first used a genetic approach. There are several transgenic mouse lines that express wild-type or mutant TDP-43, using various strategies 10},

Bonferroni correction, though computationally trivial, is overly conservative and fails to account for linkage disequilibrium between variants. Permutation-based methods are more powerful, though computationally far more intensive. We present an alternative correction method called eigenMT, which runs over 500 times faster than permutations and has adjusted p values that closely approximate empirical ones. To achieve this speed while also maintaining the accuracy of permutation-based methods, we estimate the effective number of independent variants tested for association with a particular gene, termed Meff, by using the eigenvalue decomposition of the genotype correlation matrix. We employ a regularized estimator of the correlation matrix to ensure Meff is robust and yields adjusted p values that closely approximate p values from permutations. Finally, using a common genotype matrix, we show that eigenMT can be applied with even greater efficiency to studies across tissues or conditions. Our method provides a simpler, more efficient approach to multiple-testing correction than existing methods and fits within existing pipelines for eQTL discovery.},

We identified that genes on the X chromosome are more likely to have sex-specific expression compared to the autosomal genes. Furthermore, we identified a depletion of regulatory variants on the X chromosome, especially among genes under high selective constraint. In contrast, we discovered an enrichment of sex-specific regulatory variants on the X chromosome. To resolve the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects, we generated and connected sex-specific chromatin accessibility to sex-specific expression and regulatory variation. As sex-specific regulatory variants can inform sex differences in genetic disease prevalence, we have integrated our data with genome-wide association study data for multiple immune traits and to identify traits with significant sex biases.

 abstract = {Stochastic variational inference (SVI) is emerging as the most promising candidate for scaling inference in Bayesian probabilistic models to large datasets. However, the performance of these methods has been assessed primarily in the context of Bayesian topic models, particularly latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Deriving several new algorithms, and using synthetic, image and genomic datasets, we investigate whether the understanding gleaned from LDA applies in the setting of sparse latent factor models, specifically beta process factor analysis (BPFA). We demonstrate that the big picture is consistent: using Gibbs sampling within SVI to maintain certain posterior dependencies is extremely effective. However, we find that different posterior dependencies are important in BPFA relative to LDA. Particularly, approximations able to model intra-local variable dependence perform best.},

The simplest possible models subdivide nodes of the network into clusters; the probability of a link between any two nodes then depends only on their cluster assignment. Currently available models can be classified by whether clusters are disjoint or are allowed to overlap. These models can explain a flat clustering structure. Hierarchical Bayesian models provide a natural approach to capture more complex dependencies. We propose a model in which objects are characterised by a latent feature vector. Each feature is itself partitioned into disjoint groups (subclusters), corresponding to a second layer of hierarchy. In experimental comparisons, the model achieves significantly improved predictive performance on social and biological link prediction tasks.

The key challenge in either setting is controlling the variance of gradient estimates: recent work has shown that for continuous latent variables, particularly multivariate Gaussians, this can be achieved by using the gradient of the log posterior. In this paper we apply the same idea to gamma distributed latent variables given gamma variational distributions, enabling straightforward "black box" variational inference in models where sparsity and non-negativity are appropriate. We demonstrate the method on a recently proposed gamma process model for network data, as well as a novel sparse factor analysis.

 abstract = {Nucleus classification is a central task in digital pathology. Given a tissue image, our goal is to classify detected nuclei into different types, for example nuclei of tumor cells, stroma cells, or immune cells. State-of-the-art methods achieve this by extracting different types of features such as morphology, image intensities, and texture features in the nucleus regions. Such features are input to training and classification, e.g. using a support vector machine. In this paper, we introduce additional contextual information obtained from neighboring nuclei or texture in the surrounding tissue regions to improve nucleus classification. Three different methods are presented. These methods use conditional random fields (CRF), texture features computed in image patches centered at each nucleus, and a novel method based on the bag-of-word (BoW) model. The methods are evaluated on images of tumor-burdened tissue from H&E-stained and Ki-67-stained breast samples. The experimental results show that contextual information systematically improves classification accuracy. The proposed BoW-based method performs better than the CRF-based method, and requires less computation than the texture-feature-based method.},

However, for each allele, accurate interpretation of its effect will depend on both its penetrance and the trait's expressivity. In this regard, an important factor that can modify the effect of a pathogenic coding allele is its level of expression; a factor which itself characteristically changes across tissues. To better inform the degree to which pathogenic alleles can be modified by expression level across multiple tissues, we have conducted exome, RNA and deep, targeted allele-specific expression (ASE) sequencing in ten tissues obtained from a single individual. By combining such data, we report the impact of rare and common loss-of-function variants on allelic expression exposing stronger allelic bias for rare stop-gain variants and informing the extent to which rare deleterious coding alleles are consistently expressed across tissues. This study demonstrates the potential importance of transcriptome data to the interpretation of pathogenic protein-coding variants.},

Unlike in the Dirichlet diffusion tree, multiple copies of a particle may exist and diffuse along multiple branches in the beta diffusion tree, and an object may therefore belong to multiple subsets of particles. We demonstrate how to build a hierarchically-clustered factor analysis model with the beta diffusion tree and how to perform inference over the random tree structures with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

In this note we take the former perspective and derive the ideal set of control variates for stochastic approximation variational Bayes under a certain set of assumptions. We then show that using these control variates is closely related to using the stochastic linear regression approximation technique we proposed earlier.

 abstract = {Recent and rapid human population growth has led to an excess of rare genetic variants that are expected to contribute to an individual's genetic burden of disease risk. To date, much of the focus has been on rare protein-coding variants, for which potential impact can be estimated from the genetic code, but determining the impact of rare noncoding variants has been more challenging. To improve our understanding of such variants, we combined high-quality genome sequencing and RNA sequencing data from a 17-individual, three-generation family to contrast expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) within this family to eQTLs and sQTLs within a population sample. Using this design, we found that eQTLs and sQTLs with large effects in the family were enriched with rare regulatory and splicing variants (minor allele frequency 0.01). They were also more likely to influence essential genes and genes involved in complex disease. In addition, we tested the capacity of diverse noncoding annotation to predict the impact of rare noncoding variants. We found that distance to the transcription start site, evolutionary constraint, and epigenetic annotation were considerably more informative for predicting the impact of rare variants than for predicting the impact of common variants. These results highlight that rare noncoding variants are important contributors to individual gene-expression profiles and further demonstrate a significant capability for genomic annotation to predict the impact of rare noncoding variants..},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that gene expression levels change with age. These changes are hypothesized to influence the aging rate of an individual. We analyzed gene expression changes with age in abdominal skin, subcutaneous adipose tissue and lymphoblastoid cell lines in 856 female twins in the age range of 39-85 years. Additionally, we investigated genotypic variants involved in genotype-by-age interactions to understand how the genomic regulation of gene expression alters with age. RESULTS: Using a linear mixed model, differential expression with age was identified in 1,672 genes in skin and 188 genes in adipose tissue. Only two genes expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines showed significant changes with age. Genes significantly regulated by age were compared with expression profiles in 10 brain regions from 100 postmortem brains aged 16 to 83 years. We identified only one age-related gene common to the three tissues. There were 12 genes that showed differential expression with age in both skin and brain tissue and three common to adipose and brain tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Skin showed the most age-related gene expression changes of all the tissues investigated, with many of the genes being previously implicated in fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial activity, cancer and splicing. A significant proportion of age-related changes in gene expression appear to be tissue-specific with only a few genes sharing an age effect in expression across tissues. More research is needed to improve our understanding of the genetic influences on aging and the relationship with age-related diseases.},

The latent variables preserve neighbourhood structure of the data in a sense that objects in the same semantic concept have similar latent values, and objects in different concepts have dissimilar latent values. We formulate the supervised infinite latent variable problem based on an intuitive principle of pulling objects together if they are of the same type, and pushing them apart if they are not. We then combine this principle with a flexible Indian Buffet Process prior on the latent variables. We show that the inferred supervised latent variables can be directly used to perform a nearest neighbour search for the purpose of retrieval.

Statistical cluster analysis of intrinsic firing properties revealed that Hcrt/Orx neurons fall into two distinct types. These two cell types also differ in the complexity of their dendritic arbour, the strength of AMPA and GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic drive that they receive, and the density of low-threshold, 4-aminopyridine-sensitive, transient K+ current.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epigenome refers to marks on the genome, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, that regulate the expression of underlying genes. A consistent profile of gene expression changes in end-stage cardiomyopathy led us to hypothesize that distinct global patterns of the epigenome may also exist.  METHODS AND RESULTS: We constructed genome-wide maps of DNA methylation and histone-3 lysine-36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) enrichment for cardiomyopathic and normal human hearts. More than 506 Mb sequences per library were generated by high-throughput sequencing, allowing us to assign methylation scores to ≈28 million CG dinucleotides in the human genome. DNA methylation was significantly different in promoter CpG islands, intragenic CpG islands, gene bodies, and H3K36me3-enriched regions of the genome. DNA methylation differences were present in promoters of upregulated genes but not downregulated genes. H3K36me3 enrichment itself was also significantly different in coding regions of the genome. Specifically, abundance of RNA transcripts encoded by the DUX4 locus correlated to differential DNA methylation and H3K36me3 enrichment. In vitro, Dux gene expression was responsive to a specific inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, and Dux siRNA knockdown led to reduced cell viability.  CONCLUSIONS: Distinct epigenomic patterns exist in important DNA elements of the cardiac genome in human end-stage cardiomyopathy. The epigenome may control the expression of local or distal genes with critical functions in myocardial stress response. If epigenomic patterns track with disease progression, assays for the epigenome may be useful for assessing prognosis in heart failure.

 abstract = {We demonstrate efficient approximate inference for the Dirichlet Diffusion Tree (Neal, 2003), a Bayesian nonparametric prior over tree structures. Although DDTs provide a powerful and elegant approach for modeling hierarchies they haven't seen much use to date. One problem is the computational cost of MCMC inference. We provide the first deterministic approximate inference methods for DDT models and show excellent performance compared to the MCMC alternative. We present message passing algorithms to approximate the Bayesian model evidence for a specific tree. This is used to drive sequential tree building and greedy search to find optimal tree structures, corresponding to hierarchical clusterings of the data. We demonstrate appropriate observation models for continuous and binary data. The empirical performance of our method is very close to the computationally expensive MCMC alternative on a density estimation problem, and significantly outperforms kernel density estimators.},

 abstract = {Variational Message Passing (VMP) is an algorithmic implementation of the Variational Bayes (VB) method which applies only in the special case of conjugate exponential family models. We propose an extension to VMP, which we refer to as Non-conjugate Variational Message Passing (NCVMP) which aims to alleviate this restriction while maintaining modularity, allowing choice in how expectations are calculated, and integrating into an existing message-passing framework: Infer.NET. We demonstrate NCVMP on logistic binary and multinomial regression. In the multinomial case we introduce a novel variational bound for the softmax factor which is tighter than other commonly used bounds whilst maintaining computational tractability.},

The generative process is described and shown to result in an exchangeable distribution over data points. We prove some theoretical properties of the model and then present two inference methods: a collapsed MCMC sampler which allows us to model uncertainty over tree structures, and a computationally efficient greedy Bayesian EM search algorithm. Both algorithms use message passing on the tree structure. The utility of the model and algorithms is demonstrated on synthetic and real world data, both continuous and binary.},

 abstract = {Nonparametric Bayesian models provide a framework for flexible probabilistic modelling of complex datasets. Unfortunately, Bayesian inference methods often require high-dimensional averages and can be slow to compute, especially with the potentially unbounded representations associated with nonparametric models. We address the challenge of scaling nonparametric Bayesian inference to the increasingly large datasets found in real-world applications, focusing on the case of parallelising inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). Our approach divides a large data set between multiple processors. The processors use message passing to compute likelihoods in an asynchronous, distributed fashion and to propagate statistics about the global Bayesian posterior. This novel MCMC sampler is the first parallel inference scheme for IBP-based models, scaling to datasets orders of magnitude larger than had previously been possible.},

 abstract = {We aim to detect minor variant Hepatitis B viruses (HBV) in 38 pyrosequencing samples from infected individuals. Errors involved in the amplification and ultra deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) of these samples are characterised using HBV plasmid controls. Homopolymeric regions and quality scores are found to be significant covariates in determining insertion and deletion (indel) error rates, but not mismatch rates which depend on the nucleotide transition matrix. This knowledge is used to derive two methods for classifying genuine mutations: a hypothesis testing framework and a mixture model. Using an approximate "ground truth" from a limiting dilution Sanger sequencing run, these methods are shown to outperform the naive percentage threshold approach. The possibility of early stage PCR errors becoming significant is investigated by simulation, which underlines the importance of the initial copy number.},

Whether a given source is active for a specific data point is specified by an infinite binary matrix, Z. The resulting sparse representation allows increased data reduction compared to standard ICA. We define a prior on Z using the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). We describe four variants of the model, with Gaussian or Laplacian priors on X and the one or two-parameter IBPs.
