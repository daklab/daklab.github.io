	<b>Abstract</b>: Abstract Although defined by end-stage neuronal loss, neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly hypothesized to be initiated by early microglial dysfunction. Genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is particularly highly enriched for non-coding variants located in microglia-specific regulatory regions. Yet, the linkage-dense nature of these variants limits their functional interpretation. To elucidate how risk variants influence microglial gene regulation, we contrast fine-mapping of AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci by four complementary methods, and resolve a highly concordant set of putative causal variants. In total, 11,550 candidate regulatory sequences (CRSs), nominated from GWAS (n = 2,183), microglial expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) (n = 5,721) and microglial chromatin accessibility QTL (n = 1,519), are screened en masse by massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia (iMGL) and immortalized HMC3 cell lines. Distinct sets of functional variants are identified between cellular models, underscoring the importance of using physiologically relevant microglia for variant interpretation. Functional regulatory variants (frVar) are enriched in promoters and splicing regions, with over half predicted to disrupt transcription factor (TF) binding. The affected TFs yield distinct regulatory modules, the first with an inflammatory program and the second with a DNA stress-response network. Mapping frVar to their predicted target genes reveals enrichment for biological processes related to amyloid biology, immune signaling, and neuron-microglia communication. Notably, we pinpoint functional variants within several understudied AD loci, including TSPOAP1, providing direct evidence for causal regulatory effects. Together, these findings establish the first large-scale microglial-context MPRA, define a microglial regulome underlying AD genetic risk, and provide a functional framework to refine noncoding variant interpretation and therapeutic target discovery.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is among the most abundant post-transcriptional modifications, whose role in homeostasis and disease of the central nervous system (CNS) has been extensively reported. Regulation of A-to-I editing by cis-acting genetic variants (edQTLs) is understudied, especially in the brain. As a part of the BigBrain Project (n=4,471 individuals), which represents a >10-fold increase in sample size from previous edQTL studies, we harmonized A-to-I sites across datasets to perform a meta-analysis that identified 38,731 edQTLs in 3,554 genes. Integrating other QTL summary statistics from BigBrain, we show edQTLs in 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) are more likely to share a genetic effect with gene expression or splicing. Using colocalization analysis, we identify 24 GWAS loci for neurological disorders explained by edQTLs alone, or in concert with other molecular QTLs. This study represents a valuable resource to the field of RNA editing and neurogenetics.

	<b>Abstract</b>: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation of cell

	<b>Abstract</b>: Alternative splicing shapes isoform diversity and gene dosage but how genetic variation impacts splicing in brain disease is still not fully characterized. We assembled BigBrain, a multi-ancestry resource of 10,725 bulk RNA-seq profiles with matched genotypes from 4,656 individuals across 43 tissue-cohort pairs, and mapped 68,358 cis-sQTLs affecting 10,966 genes using mixed-model meta-analysis. Using SuSiE, we were able to finemap over half of these sQTLs into 95% credible sets, frequently to a single variant near splice sites. We further annotated variants predicted to alter dosage through frameshifts or nonsense-mediated decay or disrupt protein domains. Colocalization with seven neurodegenerative and psychiatric GWAS highlighted 97 loci where alternative splicing appears to mediate genetic risk. Among sQTL-eQTL pairs with colocalization probability ≥ 0.8 (posterior probability of a shared causal variant), half shared credible-set variants, showing that splicing can complement or act independently of expression. Mechanistic examples include CAMLG, ZDHHC2, and CLU.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Alternative splicing is a key mechanism by which genetic variation contributes to human phenotypic diversity and disease risk, yet its incorporation into large-scale genetic studies remains limited. Here we utilize blood RNA-seq from 4,732 European-ancestry individuals in the INTERVAL cohort to construct genetic scores for junction-based splicing phenotypes, 13,851 of which have external R2 > 0.01 in held-out individuals. These models were imputed into the UK Biobank (UKBB; n=408,590) and All of Us (AoU; n=201,958), enabling splicing transcriptome-wide association studies (sTWAS) across 1,191 harmonized disease phenotypes. We identified 4,953 splicing-disease associations, of which 66% were shared across cohorts. To account for confounding by co-regulation and linkage disequilibrium, we used a novel Bayesian joint fine-mapping framework to prioritize 1,271 likely causal splicing-disease associations across 492 genes, revealing mechanisms underlying immune, vascular, and metabolic traits. Fine-mapped associations included exon-skipping events in GSDMB and splicing in untranslated regions in STAT6 and IL18RAP for asthma, unannotated splicing events in PIEZO1 and PPP3R1 for vascular traits, and alternative exons in BAK1 and TNFRSF14 for celiac disease. Our study demonstrates that common genetic variation influencing splicing substantially shapes complex trait architecture and provides a scalable, statistically rigorous framework to uncover transcriptional disease mechanisms.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Single-cell perturbation dictionaries provide systematic measurements of how cells respond to genetic and chemical perturbations, and create the opportunity to assign causal interpretations to observational data. Here, we introduce RNA fingerprinting, a statistical framework that maps transcriptional responses from new experiments onto reference perturbation dictionaries. RNA fingerprinting learns denoised perturbation ``fingerprints'' from single-cell data, then probabilistically assigns query cells to one or more candidate perturbations while accounting for uncertainty. We benchmark our method across ground-truth datasets, demonstrating accurate assignments at single-cell resolution, scalability to genome-wide screens, and the ability to resolve combinatorial perturbations. We demonstrate its broad utility across diverse biological settings: identifying context-specific regulators of p53 under ribosomal stress, characterizing drug mechanisms of action and dose-dependent off-target effects, and uncovering cytokine-driven B cell heterogeneity during secondary influenza infection in vivo. Together, these results establish RNA fingerprinting as a versatile framework for interpreting single-cell datasets by linking cellular states to the underlying perturbations which generated them.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Groups of complex diseases, such as coronary heart diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, and cancers, often display overlapping clinical symptoms and pharmacological treatments. The shared associations of genetic variants across diseases has the potential to explain their underlying biological processes, but this remains poorly understood. To address this, we model the matrix of summary statistics of trait-associated genetic variants as the sum of a low-rank component - representing shared biological processes - and a sparse component, representing unique processes and arbitrarily corrupted or contaminated components. We introduce Clorinn, an open-source Python software that uses convex optimization algorithms to recover these components by minimizing a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm. Among others, Clorinn provides two significant benefits: (a) Convex optimization guarantees reproducibility of the components, and (b) The low-rank ``uncorrupted'' matrix allows robust singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component analysis (PCA), which are otherwise highly sensitive to outliers and noise in the input matrix. In extensive simulations, we observe that Clorinn outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in capturing the shared latent factors across phenotypes. We apply Clorinn to estimate 200 latent factors from GWAS summary data of 2,110 phenotypes measured in European-ancestry Pan-UK BioBank individuals N = 420,531 and 14 psychiatric disorders.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) in blood, a form of clonal hematopoiesis, have been linked to various diseases, but their role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. We analyzed blood whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 24,049 individuals in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project and found that autosomal mCAs were significantly associated with increased AD risk (odds ratio = 1.27; P = 1.3e-5). This association varied by ancestry, mCA subtype, APOE ε4 allele status, and chromosomal location. Using matched blood WGS and brain single-nucleus RNA-seq data, we identified microglia-annotated cells in the brain carrying the same mCAs found in blood. These findings suggest that blood mCAs may contribute to AD pathogenesis, potentially through infiltration into the brain and influencing local immune response.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Subcellular RNA organization can affect critical cellular functions. However, our understanding of RNA microenvironments, particularly biomolecular condensates, remains limited, largely due to a lack of technologies to comprehensively interrogate mesoscale RNA organization. Here, we adapt Split-Pool Recognition of Interactions by Tag Extension to map micron-scale RNA-RNA spatial proximity genome-wide across cell regions (RNA-SPRITE). Deploying RNA-SPRITE, we find extensive, conserved organization of mature mRNAs, with increased colocalization between mRNAs that share RNA-binding protein (RBP) motifs or encode functionally related proteins. Both effects are especially strong in dendrites and axons, suggesting prevalent mRNA co-regulation. Moreover, mRNAs with less compact folding, lower translation efficiency, and specific RBP motifs are more likely to be in RNA-rich condensates. However, perturbations that broadly dissolve or enhance condensation reveal that RBP motif and encoded protein-mediated colocalizations largely remain intact, independent of condensation. These results demonstrate the power of RNA-SPRITE in revealing critical aspects of RNA’s functional organization. In Brief: Unbiased, genome-wide maps of RNA-RNA mesoscale spatial proximity uncover extensive subcellular organization and its governing principles. Highlights: RNA-SPRITE reveals micron-scale RNA colocalization genome-wide across cell regions; mRNA colocalization specificity is driven by shared motifs and encoded protein function; mRNAs with less compact folding, lower translation efficiency, and distinct protein-binding motifs are more likely to be in condensates; Neurites have a particularly high degree of sequence and function-dependent mRNA organization.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Understanding lineage differentiation is an ongoing challenge in the field of stem cell research. We acquired eight gain-of-function (GOF) oncogenic mutations associated with DNA methylation alteration from the TCGA datasets. After introducing each oncogene into wild-type stem cells separately, we found that the mutant stem cells are difficult to reprogram to iPSCs and terminally differentiate to induced neuronal cells, and retain proliferation capacity in the process of differentiation. This findings suggests that oncogenic mutations impair the lineage differentiation. After analyzing the resulting DNA methylation profiles, we identified many novel lineage differentiation genes in mutant cells showing DNA methylation alteration compared with wild-type cells, which is consistent with their methylation states in low-grade gliomas (LGGs) compared with control brain. Collectively, our results indicate that oncogenic mutations in stem cells are associated with DNA methylation changes for genes related to multipotency maintenance, differentiation resistance, and tumorigenesis, therefore, displaying impairment in lineage commitment.

Here, we present SPLISOSM (SpatiaL ISOform Statistical Modeling), a computational framework for detecting isoform-resolution patterns from spatial transcriptomics data. SPLISOSM leverages multivariate testing to account for spot- and isoform-level dependencies, demonstrating robust and theoretically grounded performance on sparse data. In the mouse brain, we identify over 1,000 spatially variable transcript diversity events, primarily in synaptic signaling pathways linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, and uncover both known and novel regulatory relationships with region-specific RNA binding proteins. We further show that these patterns are evolutionarily conserved between mouse and human prefrontal cortex. Analysis of human glioblastoma highlights pervasive transcript diversity in antigen presentation and adhesion genes associated with specific microenvironmental conditions. Together, we present a comprehensive spatial splicing analysis in the brain under normal and neoplastic conditions.HighlightsMultivariate tests of spatial variability and association for transcript usageConserved isoform variability in synaptic pathways across mouse and human brainsCoordinated RNA binding protein expression drives region-specific regulationTumor microenvironment shapes spatial transcript landscapes in human glioma

	<b>Abstract</b>: Long-read sequencing (LRS) has revealed a far greater diversity of RNA isoforms than earlier technologies, increasing the critical need to determine which, and how many, isoforms per gene are biologically meaningful. To define the space of relevant isoforms from LRS, many existing analysis pipelines rely on arbitrary expression cutoffs, but a single threshold cannot accommodate the broad variability in isoform complexity across genes, cell-types, and disease states captured by LRS. To address this, we propose using perplexity, an interpretable measure derived from entropy, that quantifies the effective number of isoforms per gene based on the full, unfiltered isoform ratio distribution. Calculating perplexity for 124 ENCODE4 PacBio LRS datasets spanning 55 human cell types, we show that it provides intuitive assessments of isoform diversity and captures uncertainty across genes with varying complexity. Perplexity can be calculated at multiple gene regulatory levels, from transcript to protein, to compare how isoform diversity is reduced across stages of gene expression. On average, genes have an ORF-level perplexity of 2.1, indicating production of two distinct protein isoforms. We extended this analysis to evaluate expression variation across tissues and identified 4,593 ORFs across 3,102 genes with moderate to extreme tissue-specificity. We propose perplexity as a consistent, quantitative metric for interpreting isoform diversity across genes, cell types, and disease states. All results are compiled into a community resource to enable cross-study comparisons of novel isoforms.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Most genetic risk variants for neurological diseases are located in non-coding regulatory regions, where they may often act as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), modulating gene expression and influencing disease susceptibility. However, eQTL studies in bulk brain tissue or specific cell types lack the resolution to capture the brain's cellular diversity. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) offers high-resolution mapping of eQTLs across diverse brain cell types. Here, we performed a meta-analysis, SingleBrain, integrating publicly available snRNA-seq and genotype data from four cohorts, totaling 5.8 million nuclei from 983 individuals. We mapped cis-eQTLs across major brain cell types and subtypes and employed statistical colocalization and Mendelian randomization to identify genes mediating neurological disease risk. We observed up to a 10-fold increase in cis-eQTLs compared to previous studies and uncovered novel cell type-specific genes linked to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia that were previously undetectable in bulk tissue analyses. Additionally, we prioritized putative causal variants for each locus through fine-mapping and integration with cell type-specific enhancer and promoter regulatory elements. SingleBrain represents a comprehensive single-cell eQTL resource, advancing insights into the genetic regulation of brain disorders.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are challenging to interpret because most lie in non-coding regions of the genome. Here, a method was developed that integrates deep learning variant effect prediction (DL-VEP) scores from Enformer, DeepSea, and ChromBPNet models with cell-type specific regulatory annotations to improve fine-mapping of causal AD variants. Using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression, the largest proportion of heritability among brain cell types was found in microglia and the integration of Enformer microglia-based transcription factor DL-VEP scores and microglia ChromBPNet models further localizes the AD polygenic signal allowing for improved fine-mapping of causal AD variants. Functionally-informed fine-mapping using these annotations discovers 101 AD risk variants compared to 87 identified by statistical fine-mapping alone. Importantly, polygenic risk scores derived from these fine-mapped variants show improved cross-ancestry performance in both African American (AUC=0.532 vs. 0.521 for SUSIE) and Hispanic (AUC=0.552 vs. 0.535 for SUSIE) populations, while maintaining strong performance in European populations (AUC=0.620 vs. 0.615 for SUSIE). Through detailed analysis of the PICALM/EED locus, we demonstrate how our approach disentangles causal variants in regions of high linkage disequilibrium and predicts specific molecular mechanisms, such as disruption of PU.1 transcription factor binding, with the posterior inclusion probability of this variant increasing from 0.55 using SUSIE to 0.90 with our method. Our results provide a framework for leveraging deep learning annotations to improve identification of causal disease variants and enhance polygenic risk prediction across diverse populations.
