										<h2>Knowles lab</h2>
					<p><a href="http://www.nygenome.org/">New York Genome Center</a> / Columbia University</p>
									</header>
									<p>The Knowles lab develops and applies machine learning methods for data analysis challenges in genomics. We're particularly interested in understanding the role of transcriptomic dysregulation across the spectrum from rare to common genetic disease. This involves better characterization of the genetic and environmental factors contributing to mRNA expression and splicing variation. We collaborate with diverse research groups at NYGC and beyond collecting large-scale genomics datasets in the context of <a href="http://www.nygenome.org/lab-groups-overview/center-genomics-neurodegenerative-disease-phatnani-lab/">neurological disease</a> and developing <a href="http://www.nygenome.org/lab-groups-overview/technology-innovation-lab/">novel genomic technologies</a> including <a href="https://satijalab.org/">single cell methods</a>, <a href="http://sanjanalab.org/home.html">forward genetic screens</a> and <a href="https://tllab.org/">long-read transcriptomics</a>.</p>

									<p>If you're interested in machine-learning-flavored genomics, gene regulation and/or RNA splicing, please get in <a href="mailto:daknowles@nygenome.org">touch</a>! We have experimental lab space so that includes wet lab people looking to do damp (mixed computational/experimental) projects. I'm also interested in hearing from machine learning folks who are curious about applying their expertise in genetics/genomics.</p>
									
									<p>All lab members will have the option of being cross-trained in both computational analysis and experimental work. Postdocs and students are eligible for an appointment at Columbia University.</p>									<ul class="feature-icons">

									<h4>RNA splicing</h4>
									<p>We developed <a href="https://github.com/davidaknowles/leafcutter">LeafCutter</a> to identify, quantify and test variable intron splicing events, obviating the need for accurate transcript annotations and circumventing the challenges in estimating relative isoform abundance (<a href="#LeafCutter">link</a>). An early version of <em>LeafCutter</em> was used in <a href="#Li2016splicing">our study</a> linking complex disease and splicing. </p>

								<section id="eagle"> <div>
								<h4>Genetic differences in environmental response</h4>
								<p>Phenotypic variation results from the interplay of genotype and environment: in particular genetic variation can modulate the transcriptomic response to perturbation. However, detecting gene by environment effects on the transcriptome is challenging in observational data. We developed a computational method, <a href="#Knowles2017gxe">EAGLE</a>, which leverages allele-specific expression as a controlled, with-in individual test of the influence of environment factors on different genetic backgrounds. Code is available on <a href="https://github.com/davidaknowles/eagle">github</a>. </p>
								<p>Direct in vitro perturbation of cells can greatly increase power to detect GxE interaction effects due to increased effect sizes and controlled conditions. We have used human iPSC-derived somatic  cells to understand the genetic basis of cardiac sensitvity to doxorubicin. Anthracycline-cardiotoxicity (ACT) is a common side-effect of chemotherapy, but its genetic basis and molecular mechanism remain unclear. We measured transcriptomic and cellular damage response to doxorubicin in a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals. Using a novel, efficient linear mixed model, <a href="https://github.com/davidaknowles/suez">suez</a>, we identified hundreds of loci that interact with ACT response. These response-QTLs are significantly enriched in ACT GWAS (<a href="#Knowles2018dox">link</a>). </p>

								<h4>Variational methods</h4>
								<p>Variational methods offer a computationally efficient alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference in Bayesian probabilistic models. My work allows such methods to be more easily applied to a broader range of probabilistic models. I extended variational message passing to "non-conjugate" (intuitively, less tractable) models, and incorporated this method, <a href="#Knowles2011c">Non-conjugate VMP</a> (NCVMP), into the publicly available <a href="http://infernet.azurewebsites.net/">Infer.NET</a> software package. Later, Tim Salimans and I did early work on <a href='#salimans2014using'>using Monte Carlo estimation within variational learning</a>, which is now an active subfield of research under the moniker "Stochastic Variational Inference".</p>
</div> </section>
							<section id="bnp"> <div>
							<h4>Bayesian nonparametric models</h4>
							<p>Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models are a category of statistical methods that automatically adapt their complexity to observed data. I have developed BNP methods for <a href="#Knowles2014">hierarchical clustering</a>, <a href="#wilson2011gaussian">heteroskedastic multivariate regression</a>, <a #href>network data</a>, <a href="#Palla2012nonparametric">variable clustering</a> and <a href='#Knowles2011nonparametric'>nonparametric sparse factor analysis</a> (NSFA). In particular, NSFA is able to adaptively choose an appropriate number of factors from data. I used this method to delineate gene co-expression modules from microarray data, and other researchers have subsequently used it in diverse applications including image denoising and EEG analysis.</p>
