												<h2>Research overview</h2>
<p><b>Quantifying alternative splicing across genotypes, cell-types and disease states.</b> Dr Knowles previously developed <a href="#LeafCutter">LeafCutter</a>, a scalable, flexible approach to quantifying alternative splicing (AS) from bulk  RNA-seq. LeafCutter represents AS via the usage rate of each splice junction relative to a group of neighboring junctions. <a href="#Li2016splicing">We</a> and others have used LeafCutter to show that for typical complex diseases a comparable number of risk variants act through AS vs expression. We are working on tools for <a href="#Isaev2023-ax">single-cell</a>, <a href="#Talukder2025-kx">long-read</a> and <a href="#Su2025-by">spatial</a> AS analysis, as well as <a href="#Schertzer2025-pv">ways to interpret</a> the remarkable isoform complexity of human cells revealed by long-read RNA-seq.</p>

<p><b>QTL mapping in thousands of brain samples.</b> RNA-seq sample sizes for brain have lagged behind other tissues. With the <a href="https://rajlab.org/">Raj lab</a> we have uniformly processed over 10,000 post-mortem bulk brain RNA-seq samples, a resource we call BigBrain. BigBrain is the largest brain quantitative trait locus (QTL) meta-analysis to date so the resulting QTLs are providing unprecedented resolution to dissect neurological disease GWAS loci. In a parallel effort, <a href="#Jang2025-vj">SingleBrain</a>, we meta-analysed brain single nuclei RNA-seq from ~1000 individuals to map cell-type & state specific expression QTLs.</p>

<p><b>Deep learning models of gene regulation for variant effect prediction.</b> QTL mapping requires large sample sizes and is only practical for common genetic variants and cell-types/states. By contrast, sequence-to-function deep learning (DL) models trained to predict chromatin marks, expression or splicing, from DNA sequence alone, only need data from a few individuals. Dr Knowles was involved in developing <a href="#Jaganathan2019-kb">SpliceAI</a>, one of the earlier methods using modern DL to do this, specifically for splice sites. The predicted difference between the reference and alternate alleles (delta scores) can be powerful predictors of variant effects, even for previously unseen variants. As part of the <a href="https://adsp.niagads.org/">Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project</a> (ADSP) we are training and assessing DL models of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and splicing in AD relevant cell types. Delta scores for microglial chromatin accessibility are strongly enriched in AD GWAS and <a href="#Lakhani2025-fs">enable improved functional fine-mapping</a>. We developed <a href="#Das2025-uy">new rare variant association models</a> to leverage these delta scores and find new genetic associations with AD. </p>

<p><b>Causal gene regulatory network inference.</b> DL models and cis QTL mapping help link molecular changes to disease but don't model how these effects propagate through the gene regulatory network (GRN). Building on <a href="#Brown2021">our earlier work</a> on robust, scalable Mendelian randomization, we developed <a href="#Brown2023-uc">inverse sparse regression</a>, which deconvolves an estimated total causal effect network into direct and indirect effects using a directed analogue of the graphical lasso. We are applying inspre to trans-eQTLs from BigBrain and neurological GWAS to map how genetic effects propagate through the GRN to impact disease risk. To adapt these ideas to the nonlinear, multiple cell-type setting we have <a href="#Lin2025-gg">developed</a> and <a href="#Zweig2025-cd">theoretically characterized</a> differential equation models of cellular dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Experimental characterization of isoform function.</b> It is currently challenging to characterise the function of putative disease relevant isoforms. To address this, we developed a <a href="#Schertzer2023-lb">strategy targeting unique exon-exon junctions</a> in mature RNA with CRISPR/Cas13d to knockdown specific isoforms and, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.nygenome.org/science-technology/faculty-labs/sanjana-lab/">Sanjana lab</a>, a DL model, <a href="#Wessels2023-ko">TIGER</a>, to predict guide RNA efficacy for this system. </p>
</div>

<p><b>Foundational machine learning.</b> We also work on foundational ML, most recently on <a href="#Su2024-ou">kernel-based latent subspace analysis</a>, <a href="#Stirn2024-qw">principled priors for variational autoencoders</a>, and <a href="#Stirn2023">heteroskedastic regression</a>.</p>

									<h4>Variational methods</h4>
									
									<p>Variational methods offer a computationally efficient alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference in Bayesian probabilistic models. My work allows such methods to be more easily applied to a broader range of probabilistic models. I extended variational message passing to "non-conjugate" (intuitively, less tractable) models, and incorporated this method, <a href="#Knowles2011c">Non-conjugate VMP</a> (NCVMP), into the publicly available <a href="http://infernet.azurewebsites.net/">Infer.NET</a> software package. Later, Tim Salimans and I did early work on <a href='#salimans2014using'>using Monte Carlo estimation within variational learning</a>, which is now an active subfield of research under the moniker "Stochastic Variational Inference".</p>
	</div> </section>
								 
							<section id="bnp"> <div>
							<h4>Bayesian nonparametric models</h4>
							<p>Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models are a category of statistical methods that automatically adapt their complexity to observed data. I have developed BNP methods for <a href="#Knowles2014">hierarchical clustering</a>, <a href="#wilson2011gaussian">heteroskedastic multivariate regression</a>, <a href="#palla2012infinite">network data</a>, <a href="#Palla2012nonparametric">variable clustering</a> and <a href='#Knowles2011nonparametric'>nonparametric sparse factor analysis</a> (NSFA). In particular, NSFA is able to adaptively choose an appropriate number of factors from data. I used this method to delineate gene co-expression modules from microarray data, and other researchers have subsequently used it in diverse applications including image denoising and EEG analysis.</p>
